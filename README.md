# Tiple J recently played

Simple python script to auth a user with the Spotify web api, create a new playlist, and then add recently played songs from Triple J to the playlist.

## Roadmap (of sorts):   
* Query triple j for recently played songs  
* Refactor the ignore method for all ignored programmes
* Add config.json file
* Make more specific queries if possible to ABC radio's API
* Refactor into 2 modules (1 for spotipy methods, one for querying ABC radio API methods)
* Create config and spotipy client in __main__.py or __init__.py to be used elsewhere
